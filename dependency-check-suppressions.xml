        OWASP Dependency Check Suppression File

        This file contains suppressions for known false positives or accepted vulnerabilities.
        Each suppression should include:
        - A clear reason for the suppression
        - The CVE number being suppressed
        - An expiration date or review date
        - The artifact affected

        Example suppression:
        <suppress>
            <notes><![CDATA[
                False positive - CVE applies to a different artifact with similar name
                Review date: 2026-06-01
            ]]></notes>
            <packageUrl regex="true">^pkg:maven/group\.id/artifact\-id@.*$</packageUrl>
            <cve>CVE-YYYY-XXXXX</cve>
        </suppress>
    -->

    <!--
        Add suppressions below as needed.
        Common reasons for suppression:
        - False positive (different artifact or usage pattern)
        - Accepted risk (mitigated by other controls)
        - No fix available (waiting for upstream patch)
    -->

</suppressions>
